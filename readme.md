# PomoFocus

A simple TUI Pomodoro timer to help with deep focus. Built primarily for my own use.

## Why?
- The Pomodoro method is a tried and tested method for improving focus.
- This project is a good excuse to use the very aesthetic CharmBracelet Libraries: [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [lipgoss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).

## Usage
- 25 minutes
- 5 minute breaks
- Long breaks every 4th session - ability to trigger long break
